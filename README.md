# Back-to-Hue-Frontend
Creating cross-platform solution to help keep individuals connected

## First Draft:
- No backend
- Google Maps API, format into desired interactive map; First draft will be a blank map with possible state borders
- Put down a point, save that point
- Other things will be considered once finishing a solid first draft

## Technical Part:
Flutter, follow steps on this link: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-in-flutter#1
Ask for help to install if we need

## Week Jan 10-17 Tasks:
- Make map a black/white map
- Remove office points and find how locations are saved in the API
- (this part works together a bit with last part) Develop a way to create custom points

## Future Ideas:
- Have user profiles that can be linked to your phone number
- When you join the app, it lets people who have you as a contact know that you joined the app (similar function in Telegram, Signal, etc.)
- Have a timeline feature to keep track of where you have traveled so far
- Maybe have a profile picture section
- Have a nice UI for displaying timeline (think of it as a Bio except through images of places you have traveled)
- A tab with your contacts using the app currently (or not using the app yet and an option to invite them to the app through sms or other social media)
