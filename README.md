# Back-to-Hue-Frontend
Creating cross-platform solution to help keep individuals connected

## First Draft:
- No backend
- Google Maps API, format into desired interactive map; First draft will be a blank map with possible state borders
- Put down a point, save that point
- Other things will be considered once finishing a solid first draft

## For Reference:
Open source baseline: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-in-flutter#1

## Week Feb 2-9-16 Tasks:
- 1. Have a button to go into point setting mode - Jeevan
- 2. Making a custom point on a map. (Eventually: save to json, and retrieve) - Gideon
- 3. Contact system, kinda like creating a new contact. (eventually add ability to edit contacts) - Leo


## Future Ideas:
- Have user profiles that can be linked to your phone number
- When you join the app, it lets people who have you as a contact know that you joined the app (similar function in Telegram, Signal, etc.)
- Have a timeline feature to keep track of where you have traveled so far
- Maybe have a profile picture section
- Have a nice UI for displaying timeline (think of it as a Bio except through images of places you have traveled)
- A tab with your contacts using the app currently (or not using the app yet and an option to invite them to the app through sms or other social media)
